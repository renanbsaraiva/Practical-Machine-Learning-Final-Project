#Introduction

The current report deals with the following problem:

"Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement, a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset)."


#Data Sources

The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data is available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project comes from this original source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

#Load required packages

```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)

set.seed(12345)
```

#Getting data

The data can be obtained from the following links:
```{r}
trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"

testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
```

Load data to memory solely

```{r}
training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
````

#Partioning the data

```{r}

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]; myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```

#Cleaning the data

The following transformations were used to clean the data:

Transformation 1: Cleaning NearZeroVariance Variables

```{r}
myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)

myNZVvars <- names(myTraining) %in% c("new_window", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
"kurtosis_yaw_belt", "skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
"max_yaw_belt", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
"var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
"stddev_yaw_arm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
"kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
"max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
"kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
"skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
"amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
"skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
"max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
"amplitude_yaw_forearm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
"avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
"stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm")

myTraining <- myTraining[!myNZVvars]
```

Transformation 2: ID Removing

```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
```

Transformation 3: Cleaning Variables with too many NAs.

```{r}
trainingV3 <- myTraining #creating another subset to iterate in loop
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) { #for every column in the training dataset
        if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .6 ) { #if n?? NAs > 60% of total observations
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) ==1)  { #if the columns are the same:
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j] #Remove that column
            }   
        } 
    }
}
```

#Seting back to our set:

```{r}
myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)
```

Do the exact same 3 transformations but for myTesting and testing data sets.
```{r}
clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58]) #already with classe column removed TALVEZ TENHA QUE TIRAR
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]
testing <- testing[clean2]
```

coerce the data into the same type.

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
        for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) ==1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}
```

#And to make sure Coertion really worked, simple smart ass technique:

```{r}
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing) #note row 2 does not mean anything, this will be removed right.. now:
testing <- testing[-1,]
```

#Creating prediction models: Decision trees

```{r}
modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")


fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)

predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")

confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, myTesting$classe)
```

#Creating prediction models: Random Forest

```{r}
modFitB1 <- randomForest(classe ~. , data=myTraining)

predictionsB1 <- predict(modFitB1, myTesting, type = "class")

confusionMatrix(predictionsB1, myTesting$classe)
```

Random Forests yielded better Results.

#Generating Files to submit as answers for the Assignment:

```{r}
predictionsB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")
```

Function to generate files with predictions to submit for assignment

```{r}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(predictionsB2)
```
